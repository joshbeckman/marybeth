<h4>
If you like walking and want great views
</h4>
<p>
Maggie Daley park on the far eastern edge of the city is gorgeous and relatively new to the city. Marybeth and Josh lived right near there for 5 years!
</p>

<p>
The Lakefront Trail runs along the waterfront all up and down the city. It has beautiful views and can be accessed nearly everywhere if you just walk East. It also connects to the new Riverfront walk through downtown Chicago that has a lot to see.
</p>

<p>
The Adler Planetarium sits on a long pier and gives the best view of the city where you can also learn about the planets!
</p>

<p>
The Calder Lily Pond on the north end of the (FREE!) Lincoln Park Zoo is one of the most gorgeous parks in the city. Also there's a zoo!
</p>

<h4>
If you don't like walking
</h4>

<p>
The highly-regarded Chicago Architecture Tour is actually a boat ride with very little walking!
</p>

<h4>
If you like trying good beer
</h4>

<p>
Goose Island brewery is within proximity to the hotel relative to the distance between Chicago and Milwaukee and is probably the most well-known Chicago brewery.
</p>

<p>
To the north, the Moustrap / Off-Color brewery is right down the street from Josh and Marybeth and has excellent ales and sours.
</p>

<p>
Also to the north, Metropolitan brewery has a lovely deck biergarden overlooking the Chicago River and serves up some very nice pilsners and bocks.
</p>

<p>
To the south, Lagunitas brewery has a fun, decorative space that also offers tours. They specialize in strong IPAs and hazy brews.
</p>

<h4>
If you like trying good food
</h4>

<p>
Chicago's West Loop, where the hotel and venue are located, has some of the best, wide-randging restaurants.
